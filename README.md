# EssentialsButNotEssentials
A remake of the Minecraft Plugin Essentials.

I'm very new to java. So to learn I decided to try and remake the all popular Minecraft plugin essentials. Just for practise.
I'll be releasing every major change/progress I make. To enthesis: This is NOT a fork of any sort.
It's a complete remake from scratch.
I would really appreciate any feedback or criticism about my code.

The main download is on https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsbutnotessentials-0-1-essentials-remake.92969/

Would prefer if you download it from there as it will be updated more then this one on github.
Thanks for reading :D
